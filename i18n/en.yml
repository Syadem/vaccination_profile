        alymphocytosis type is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. It is characterized
        by a defect in the differentiation of T and B lymphocytes. There are several
        forms: RAG-1 or RAG-2 protein deficiency, Artemis protein deficiency characterized
        by excessive cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. DICS manifests itself
        in children, from the first months of life, by recurrent bacterial or viral
        infections (cytomegalovirus, Pneumocistis carinii), severe diarrhea and delayed
        growth. The use of live vaccines and the transfusion of non-irradiated blood
        products should be prohibited in suspected cases. The incidence is about 1/500,000
        births. Treatment consists of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
        The antenatal diagnosis of SCID is based essentially on the identification
        of the absence of the various lymphocyte populations and therefore of their
        function. This diagnosis is made at 20 weeks of pregnancy by fetal blood sampling.
        In families where a mutation of the RAG gene has been identified, or where
        the genetic link of the disease to the locus present on chromosome 10p has
        been established, an antenatal diagnosis can be made at 11 weeks of amenorrhea

        risk of chronic enterovirus infections. Its incidence is of the order of 1/200
        000 births. It is related to the absence of immunoglobulin production. It
        is an X-linked recessive inherited disease. This disease is caused by mutations
        in the gene coding for Btk tyrosine kinase. It is characterized by a defect
        in the maturation of B lymphocytes. Treatment is based mainly on the regular
        administration of immunoglobulins by the venous or subcutaneous route (source:

        involved in isotypic switching in the germinal center during antigenic stimulation;
        mutation of the NEMO gene.2) Hyper IgM syndromes with isolated humoral deficiency
        linked to an intrinsic abnormality of the B lymphocytes by mutations of the
        genes coding for AID and UNG preventing isotypic switching and not associated
        with T cell defects.As in other hypogammaglobulinemias, infections are dominated
        by respiratory and ENT infections with encapsulated bacteria (S. pneumoniae,
        Haemophilus), and more rarely with pyogenes. P. aeruginosa is isolated in
        cases of bronchial dilatation. Digestive infections are frequent with a high
        prevalence of giardiasis.In case of associated cellular deficiency, other

      C-585: "IgA deficiency"
      H-585: "Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency is a primary (or congenital) immune
        deficiency and is the most common primary antibody deficiency. With an incidence
        of 1/325 people in the West, it is not a rare disease. Due to the partial
        or total absence of IgA antibodies, which play a major role in the protection
        of mucous membranes against infections, affected individuals suffer from recurrent
        episodes of respiratory or gastrointestinal infections. They may also have
        a variable common immunodeficiency and the incidence of autoimmune disorders
        is increased. The etiology of selective immunoglobulin A deficiency is not
        elucidated, but familial transmission observed in 20-25% of cases suggests
        a genetic influence. There is no specific treatment for this disease, but
        infections must be treated effectively. Patients with selective total IgA
        deficiency should inform their caregivers because of the potential risk of
        an anaphylactic reaction when transfusing blood products. Source: Orphanet."

        example IgG2 and IgG4 are responsible for the majority of the immune response
        against encapsulated bacteria (pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b).Deficiency

        which explains the great variety of signs of the disease. The most frequent
        signs are fatigue, fever, skin and joint signs. The most severe manifestations
        are related to kidney damage, neurological disorders, anemia or low platelet
        count. Treatment. The goals of treatment are to treat acute episodes, reduce
        the risk of relapse, and improve the quality of daily life. Hydroxychloroquine
        and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are indicated for moderate forms

        this drug in combination with live attenuated vaccines. The MA for Siklos
        advises against the concomitant use of hydroxycarbamide with a live virus

      C-1069: "Outdoor exposure (cycling, camping, hiking, working outdoors)"
      C-1067: "Close and prolonged contact with local people"
      H-1067: "This question is asked because close and prolonged contact with the
        local population can encourage the transmission of meningococcus. Meningococcus
        is found in the throats of certain people known as \"meningococcus carriers\"\
        . Transmission of meningococcus from one carrier to another via droplets of
        saliva (which may then trigger meningitis) is facilitated by : \n- Close contact,
        i.e. at a distance of less than 1 metre (saliva droplets are fairly heavy
        and fall rapidly);\n- Frequent or prolonged contact (e.g. over an hour).\n
        Examples of high-risk situations during your stay: staying with a local, going
        to nightclubs, long or crowded journeys, playing contact sports, work placements
        in schools, boarding schools, etc."
